# Remediation - Amazon DocumentDB cluster multi az enabled
You can achieve high availability and read scaling in Amazon DocumentDB (with MongoDB compatibility) by using replica instances. A single Amazon DocumentDB cluster supports a single primary instance and up to 15 replica instances. These instances can be distributed across Availability Zones within the cluster's Region. The primary instance accepts read and write traffic, and replica instances accept only read requests.
The cluster volume is made up of multiple copies of the data for the cluster. However, the data in the cluster volume is represented as a single, logical volume to the primary instance and to Amazon DocumentDB replicas in the cluster. Replica instances are eventually consistent. They return query results with minimal replica lagâ€”usually much less than 100 milliseconds after the primary instance has written an update. Replica lag varies depending on the rate of database change. That is, during periods in which a large number of write operations occur for the database, you might see an increase in the replica lag.
